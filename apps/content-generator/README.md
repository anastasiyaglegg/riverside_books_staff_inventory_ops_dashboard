# Riverside Books Marketing Content Generator

## Product D — Marketing Content & Generation System

The Riverside Books Marketing Content Generator is an AI-powered product component designed to transform structured book data into customer-facing marketing content.

This repository represents my individual contribution to the Riverside Books product suite. While Riverside Books is being developed as a larger multi-product system, this particular repository focuses specifically on **Product D: Marketing Content Generator**.

## Product Role

The purpose of this product is to help Riverside Books create engaging marketing materials from shared catalog data.

The system takes structured book information and generates content that can be used for customer engagement, including:

- Promotional book descriptions
- Marketing campaigns
- Social media content
- Customer-facing recommendations

## How It Fits Into Riverside Books

Riverside Books is being developed as a four-product suite where each product is built independently and later integrated into a larger company system.

This repository owns the Marketing Content Generator component.

The product depends on a shared data contract so that all Riverside Books products can work with consistent book information, including fields such as:

- Book ID
- Title
- Author
- Genre
- Price
- Stock Status
- Description
- Rating
- Promotional Tags

Maintaining consistent data structures allows each product to communicate reliably when the complete Riverside Books platform is assembled.

## Current Goal

The current goal is to build a reliable marketing content generation system that can:

1. Accept structured book data.
2. Generate useful marketing outputs.
3. Handle realistic data variations and edge cases.
4. Provide a foundation for future AI-powered marketing workflows.
